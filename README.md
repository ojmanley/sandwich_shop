# Sandwich Shop

A small Flutter demo app that demonstrates a simple sandwich ordering UI. The app provides a quantity counter with Add / Remove buttons, and a sandwich size selector (Six-inch / Footlong). It is intended as a compact example project to explore Flutter widgets and basic state management.

## Features

- Increment and decrement sandwich quantity using Add / Remove buttons.
- Buttons become disabled when not actionable (e.g., Add disabled when the order is at or above `maxQuantity`, Remove disabled when quantity is 0).
- Choose sandwich size via a dropdown (Six-inch or Footlong).
- Small, readable codebase suitable for learning Flutter basics.

## Project structure (important files)

- `lib/main.dart` — Main application file. Contains:
	- `App` — entry `StatelessWidget` that initializes the app.
	- `OrderScreen` — the main `StatefulWidget` hosting the counter UI and size selector.
	- `OrderItemDisplay` — a `StatelessWidget` that displays the current quantity and sandwich size.
	- A default template `MyApp` / `MyHomePage` from the Flutter starter is still present.

- `pubspec.yaml` — app metadata and dependencies.
- `android/`, `ios/`, `linux/`, `macos/`, `windows/`, `web/` — platform folders generated by Flutter.
- `test/` — contains widget tests (the default starter test is present).

## How it works

- The app tracks `_quantity` (int) in `OrderScreen` state and a `_selectedSize` (String).
- The Add button's `onPressed` is set to `(_quantity >= widget.maxQuantity) ? null : _increaseQuantity` so it becomes disabled when the order is full.
- The Remove button's `onPressed` is set to `(_quantity <= 0) ? null : _decreaseQuantity` so it becomes disabled when there are no sandwiches to remove.
- The size dropdown uses `DropdownButtonFormField` with `initialValue` set to `_selectedSize` and updates state when the user picks another size.

## Getting started (Windows / PowerShell)

Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed and available on your PATH
- A connected device or emulator (Android/iOS) or desktop support enabled

Run the app

Open a PowerShell terminal in the project root (where `pubspec.yaml` is) and run:

```powershell
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Run analyzer

```powershell
flutter analyze
```

Run tests

```powershell
flutter test
```

## Customization

- Changing the maximum allowed quantity:
	- `OrderScreen` accepts an optional `maxQuantity` (code default is 10). You can change it where `OrderScreen` is constructed, for example `OrderScreen(maxQuantity: 5)`.

- Replace the dropdown with a different selector UI:
	- Change `DropdownButtonFormField` to `ToggleButtons`, `RadioListTile`, or a custom widget depending on your UX preference.

- Numeric entry alternative:
	- For typed numeric input, use a `TextField` with `keyboardType: TextInputType.number` and `inputFormatters: [FilteringTextInputFormatter.digitsOnly]` (requires importing `package:flutter/services.dart`).

## Accessibility & UX tips

- Keep disabled buttons discoverable and provide helpful labels or tooltips (for example, show "Full" or a tooltip explaining the limit).
- Add semantic labels for screen readers where appropriate.
- Validate user input if you add free-text fields and limit lengths with `maxLength` to avoid layout breakage.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Small improvements you could add:

- Add integration tests that exercise add/remove and size selection.
- Improve UI styling and accessibility.
- Wire the UI to a persistence layer (local storage) or mock backend order endpoint.

Contribution workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Open a pull request with a clear description of changes.

## Troubleshooting

- Common analyzer warnings:
	- The default `MyHomePage` template includes a `_counter` field that may show an unused-field warning if it's not used. Remove or use it to silence the warning.

- If `flutter run` fails:
	- Ensure your Flutter SDK is updated: `flutter upgrade`.
	- Ensure an emulator or device is connected: `flutter devices`.

## Next steps I can help with

- Replace the size dropdown with radio/toggle buttons.
- Add a `TextField` to collect a customer name and display it on the screen.
- Add a small widget test for the Add/Remove functionality and run the analyzer/tests.

If you'd like me to apply any of the "next steps" above, tell me which one and I'll make the change and run the analyzer/tests.
